                    The var keyword has a function-level scope, while let and const have block-level scope. Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope, which can lead to unexpected behavior. let and const provide better control over variable scoping and are not hoisted in the same way as var.

                What do you mean by REST API?

                    REST API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources, and data is transferred over HTTP in a stateless manner. RESTful APIs are designed around the principles of simplicity, scalability, and statelessness, making them suitable for building distributed systems.

                    null is often used to explicitly indicate the absence of any object value. It is a deliberate assignment of a non-value. On the other hand, undefined represents an uninitialized or undefined value. It is the default value assigned to variables that are not explicitly initialized. Both are used to represent the absence or lack of a meaningful value.
